# PROMPT: Data types are important in programming. They are the kinds of information that a program can store and manipulate. In this case, we are working with strings and integers. A string is a sequence of characters, and an integer is a whole number. In this case, we are multiplying an integer by another integer and storing the result in a variable. We are also storing a string in another variable. We add 2 to x which sets it to 3, but what happens when we add 2 to y?

output = ["3", "12"]

def oracle_function(x):
    x = 1 + 2
    y = "1"

    print(x)
    print(y)
